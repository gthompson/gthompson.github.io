<h1>The Mysterious Cities of Gold</h1>
<p>Quite simply the best cartoon series of all time. As a kid I was completely captivated by it.<p/>
It first appeared on BBC1, introduced by Philip Schofield, in about 1986/7. Forty-two episodes meant it took almost a year.
Quite a story arc for a children's cartoon. And it featured a short documentary with each episode that explained some of
the history about the Incas, Aztecs, Mayas and the conquistadors. So it was highly educational too! 
It made me really want to travel to follow the path of the setting sun.<p>
It's a story of great adventure, a world full of possibilities, of destiny, heroism, and of love for friends, and real masculinity.<p/>
It begins in 1532, the year that Francisco Pizarro conquered Peru, and Pizarro is a character who appears in several episodes.

<p>The story begins in Spain. Everyone is going on about the New World to the west - they have heard stories of the gold to be found.
The hero is a 12 year old boy, Esteban, an orphan living at the local church who was rescued as a baby while adrift at sea with his father. 
Considered to be the Child of the Sun, Esteban possesses a medallion around his neck which is rumored to be from a golden city. 
A man named Mendoza introduces himself to Esteban and tells the boy that he was the one who rescued him.
Mendoza believes Esteban's his father may still be alive somewhere.

<p>Mendoza convinces Esteban to travel to the New World with him aboard the Queen's ship in order to find his father. 
Little does Esteban know but Mendoza has also kidnapped a young Incan girl named Zia, and is planning on using the two of them to find the city of gold.
Zia also wants to find her father, and old priest back in Peru.
So Mendoza initially appears to be a evil man, but he actually turns out to be a hero, albeit one with a gold obsession like all the Spaniards (apart from Esteban).
Esteban and ZIa find they both carry similar medallions with sun symbols on them.
<p>Mendoza, his two sidekicks Pedro and Sancho, and the children soon make enemies out of the Spaniards they are traveling with led by Commander Gomez and Captain Gaspard. 
They also meet a young boy named Tao, who is the surviving member of the Hiva Empire, and he joins them in their quest. He is accompanied by his pet parrot, Cocapetl,
and carries a jar.

<p>After arriving in Lima, ancient stories and relics guide them to new people and places. 
The adventure takes them right across South America and up into Central America, and they meet many different civilisations on the way including Incas, Urubus, Aztecs and Olmecs.
They discover the golden condor, a great ship and eventually a city of gold. 

<p>Only at the end do we learn there was a great battle between the Hiva empire and Atlantis. 
Both had conquered the power of the sun and lived in peace and prosperity. 
Then a great war broke out, and the empires destroyed each other, with the power of the sun (as a kid I didn't see this what a metaphor
for nuclear power).
Foretelling this disaster, the emperor of Hiva had 7 cities of gold built, and the ship and the golden condor. Along the way we see
other glimpses of the former power of this great empire.

<p>The medallions carried by Esteban and Zia have been handed down for generations. Zia is a descendent of a line of Inca priests. 
Esteban got his from his father, a travelling prophet who made it his life's mission to discover and then defend the cities of gold.
Esteban's mother was an Inca, and the medallion was handed down by her family line. Tao's jar is revealed to be the key to operating
the power rod that controls the power of the sun.
