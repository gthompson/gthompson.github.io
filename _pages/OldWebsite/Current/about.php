<h2>Biography: How I got into science</h2>

<p>I grew up in a small village in the English countryside between Leicester and Nottingham. Like most kids I was interested in things like dinosaurs, collecting fossils from local limestone pits, and bones I could dredge out of the local brook. Back in those days, before video games, we climbed trees, built dens, played football and cricket and whizzed around on our Choppers and Tomahawks (bikes). I was also really into drawing and painting, mainly dinosaurs, and at the age of 7 had over 100 of my dinosaur paintings displayed at school. British kids will remember Take Hart and Blue Peter and I submitted several paintings to both TV programmes. I was sure I would either be a paleontologist, or an artist.</p>

<p>At age 13, I had to choose between art and science. I chose art. But my parents told me my science teacher Mr (Brian) Wightman had told them "it would be a shame if Glenn didn't continue in science". So thanks to cience teacher, I changed my decision and went for science.</p>

<p>At age 14 I did a project in human evolution which when way beyond the scope of my humanities class, and I was getting great materials from scientists working at the Natural History Museum in London (still my favourite museum, and had been since I first saw the dinosaurs as a kid). I began to think that anthropology, rather than paleontology might be the way to go.</p>

<p>Also around this time, BBC Computers were becoming a big thing and my Dad had to get one. The BBC had decided to run educational programmes to teach people how to program, and sponsored the BBC micro, made my Acorn. You could download computer programs over the radio to cassettes then load them on the computer. TV programmes taught people basic programming. And then my parents signed up for BBC BASIC programming course at the local high school. My Mum hated it, so I took her place (I was still at secondary school). I was hooked and began writing adventure games.</p>

<p>Around age 15, the time of Halley's comet, I got really into amateur astronomy. Big time. I joined the Leicester Astronomical Society, the Junior Astronomical Society, devoured my copies of Popular Astronomy and Astronomy Now, and of course Patrick Moore's "The Sky at Night" was a just. I worked all kinds of jobs to earn enough money to buy a telescope - a 10 inch Newtonian Reflector from Astro Systems. With that I got to know the night sky, got my first glimpses of Saturn's rings, and spent hours marvelling at the moon from what seemed like 60 miles above it's surface. Now I absolutely knew <b>I wanted to be an astronomer</b>. I bought all sorts of astronomy books, as well as Norton's Star Atlas 2000, the definitive guide to the night sky. I wanted to spend my life going from observatory to observatory in places like Hawaii, Tenerife, Chile and Australia.</p>

<p>Thanks to Mr Wightman years earlier I was studying all the right subjects - Maths, Physics, Chemistry and Computer Science - to study astronomy at university. I was also really interested in studying Planetary Physics and Geophysics - a course at Newcastle University. But in the end chose to go to St. Andrews University because it had the best astronomical observatories in the UK (and dark skies).</p>

<p>Those first 2 years at St. Andrews were amazing, but my interests began to lean more and more towards Cosmology, Quantum physics and Relativity. The mathematics department were also a world leader in Solar Physics. So I actual did a double major in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics. But in reality those subjects, astronomy was still a common thread. Between years 3 and 4 I was one of just 4 British students lucky enough to be accepted to the summer intern programme at CERN, the European Center for Particle Physics. Unfortunately I had to turn down another internship at the Armagh Observatory in Ireland.</p>

<p>What next? I had offers to do space physics (Imperial), space engineering (UCL) and meteorology (Reading), and considered joining the British Antartic Survey, but felt an overwhelming need to do something more practical that would have better job prospects, and I really wanted to see the world. So I went to Durham to study Exploration Geophysics.</p>

<p>I don't think I've ever learned as much as I did in that year. It was so intense, such a rewarding experience. But the oil price crashed that year, and oil companies were downsizing their exploration divisions. I got about to the 3rd round of interviews with some companies like BP and British Gas, but nowhere near a job. So what to do next?</p>

<p>I had an offer from Cambridge to invert marine seismic data, and had another option in marine seismology at the University of Washington. I was also keen to work on seismic discrimination of nuclear tests at Leeds. But when I went to Leeds, I also met with Jurgen Neuberg "Locko" over a cup of tea, and he told me all about the exciting world of volcano-seismology, and dazzled me with his brilliance. The offer of fieldwork in Italy, New Zealand and Bali was admittedly a big hook too.</p>

<p>Nine months into my PhD and the Soufriere Hills Volcano in Montserrat began erupting. Sadly for the local population, it is still erupting now 15 years later. For British volcanology though, this was a great opportunity. Locko proposed a broadband seismic network. Before long the British Geological Survey were tapping British universities for scientists and students to help out with the volcanic crisis, and my first opportunity to get involved came in June 1996, 11 months into the eruption. The practical side of volcano-monitoring blew my mind. Within minutes of arriving I was whizzing around one of the world's most dangerous volcanoes in a helicopter flown by an ex-Vietman pilot, with the doors off, sitting in the doorway with a rather dubious seat-belt, with world famous volcanologists whose papers I had read but never imagined I'd be lucky enough to meet. The volcano was having swarms, banded tremor, we were being bombed out by ash, accretionary lapilli and regularly watching pyroclastic flows go into the sea. There were maybe 20 scientists and technicians, working hard and playing hard too, meeting 3 times a week with the Governor and Chief Minister, pulling a 24-hour Ops Room rosta between us, working as hard as we could to get answers about the volcano and figure out it's next move ... and lots of great parties too! Quite simply, the best few months of my life! I now knew I wanted to specialise in volcano-observatory work, whatever that was!</p>

<p>I knew a big part of this work was technical, and I was good with computers. So I took a job as an analyst-programmer while writing up my PhD to learn better how to design and implement software systems. I enjoyed this job so much I would have been quite happy continuing with it. But I live for excitement. And when I got an out of the blue message from Steve McNutt about a job I had applied for months earlier at the Alaska Volcano Observatory, I just couldn't possibly turn that opportunity down. Steve was looking for me to develop a web-based seismic monitoring system for Alaskan volcanoes, so my analyst/programmer background was ideal. That night I went online and read about Fairbanks. I honestly thought Alaska was just igloos and polar bears. Instead I read "a 5 minute drive from Fairbanks in any direction is utter wilderness" and "the crowd at the Howling Dog Saloon is rough, tough and good-looking!". What the hell was this place? I had to find out.</p>

<p>I set off for Alaska on 11 March 1998 - my Dad's 63rd birthday. I got trapped in Chicago for 2 days by a snowstorm and was out cold on the flight from Seattle to Fairbanks. When I stirred I saw a dark, eerie landscape below me, ice and mountains. But above, I saw - for the first time - the greenish glow of the northern lights. I landed into what felt like a deep freezer in the pitch black of night, and was greeted by Steve McNutt, who dropped me off at a student hall with spare stuff he had: pots and pans, sleeping bag etc. The next morning I awoke in a winter wonderland. I'd never seen such deep snow or such a blue sky. The mountains of the Alaska Range over a hundred miles away clearly visible. I eventually found my way up to the GI at the other end of campus. The adventure was just beginning.</p>

<p>Well that's sort of how I found myself in volcano-seismology, and in particular in this weird niche of developing seismic software at volcano observatories. It was the perfect combination to equip me to overhaul the seismic monitoring programme in Montserrat.</p>

<p>I never imagined my working life would be spent mainly in Montserrat and Alaska. They are favourite places of mine. So very different from each other, extremes in their own way. But it's always important to remember where you came from too. I do miss England's rolling countryside, the footpaths that criss-cross the whole country, the good old BBC the best TV and radio in the world. Being able to go to the doctor, the dentist or the hospital without it costing you an arm and a leg. In some ways England is dull and safe, in others it's just the best place there is. Time for a nice cup of tea...</p>
