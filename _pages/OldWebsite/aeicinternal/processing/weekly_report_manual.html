<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-998213"></A>mkdir week_YEAR_MO_DA</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-998214"></A>&nbsp;</P>

This will determine the minimum magnitude of events that will be included in the weekly highlights.<BR>
Note: In case of an active aftershock sequence with tens of aftershocks over M3.5, the magnitude cut-off may be increased to 4.0.</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-998226"></A>&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="Body">
<A NAME="pgfId-998227"></A>6. Click on each button in the weekly_report_tool GUI in sequence, beginning with &quot;Concatenate daily databases&quot;. The concatenation process may take some time, be patient. </P>
