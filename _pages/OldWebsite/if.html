                  <p>If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
                  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>
                  If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you<br>
                  But make allowance for their doubting too,<br>
                  If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
                  Or being lied about, don&#39;t deal in lies,<br>
                  Or being hated, don&#39;t give way to hating,<br>
                  And yet don&#39;t look too good, nor talk too wise: </p>
                  <p>If you can dream--and not make dreams your master,<br>
                  If you can think--and not make thoughts your aim;<br>
                  If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
                  And treat those two impostors just the same;<br>
                  If you can bear to hear the truth you&#39;ve spoken<br>
                  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
                  Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
                  And stoop and build &#39;em up with worn-out tools: </p>
                  <p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
                  And risk it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
                  And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
                  And never breath a word about your loss;<br>
                  If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
                  To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
                  And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
                  Except the Will which says to them: &quot;Hold on!&quot; </p>
                  <p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
                  Or walk with kings--nor lose the common touch,<br>
                  If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;<br>
                  If all men count with you, but none too much,<br>
                  If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
                  With sixty seconds&#39; worth of distance run,<br>
                  Yours is the Earth and everything that&#39;s in it,<br>
                  And--which is more--you&#39;ll be a Man, my son! </p>
