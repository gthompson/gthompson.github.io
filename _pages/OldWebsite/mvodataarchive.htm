<p>The Montserrat Volcano Observatory Seismic Data Archive</p>
<p>While working as MVO Seismologist from 2000-2003, it became apparent that 
little effort had been made to secure what was an extremely valuable 
volcano-seismic dataset, and even less effort had been made to make it 
accessible to researchers. </p>
<p>The first step was to put in place data acquisition and archival, as 
following Y2K, there was 50% downtime. Once these initial problems were solved, 
a major effort was made to recover old data from a hundreds of media which 
included tracker tapes, CDs, Zip100 disks and DDS-1 DAT tapes (this took 
hundreds of hours). Hard drive storage capacity was also boosted from around 4GB 
to 400GB, and then to over 1TB to allow online databases of all raw and derived 
MVO seismic data to be compiled. Data were also rearchived to higher capacity 
DDS-3 DAT tapes.</p>
<p>Following my original effort, hardware failures and other problems at MVO 
twice led to effectively loss of all online seismic data. Proposals I made to 
have these data securely archived outside of MVO did not go ahead, as it seemed 
noone was convinced as I was that these data are extremely valuable for 
long-term scientific research. It seems therefore distinctly possible than in 
years from now someone might want to ask questions about Montserrat seismicity, 
and contact the primary organisations involved in monitoring the volcano, only 
to be told &quot;oh sorry, those data don't exist anymore&quot;.</p>
<p>So here is my effort, small though it may be, to archive these data for 
&quot;science&quot;, and at least make the research community aware of what data I have.</p>
<p>Note however, I cannot put raw seismic data online here. Those data are the 
property of the Montserrat Volcano Observatory and the British Geological 
Survey. Instead, what I present here are derived data that I automatically 
generated while at MVO, and during my research work thereafter. However, they 
are sufficient to show what data exist.</p>
