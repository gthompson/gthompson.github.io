          <TD><i>Biography</i><p align="justify">As a kid, I was interested in 
          space, volcanoes and dinosaurs and I used to collect fossils, rocks 
          and bones. As a teenager I worked jobs do save up to buy a telescope, 
          a 10&quot; Newtonian reflector, through which spent hours gazing at craters 
          on the moon, Jupiter&#39;s red spot, and Saturn&#39;s rings, and reading about 
          astronomy. At school I did a project on human evolution and 
          specialised in physics and mathematics, and computer science. My 
          scientific interests spanned cosmology, planetary science, 
          anthropology and environmental issues.<p align="justify">In 1989 I 
          went to university. The only course in the UK combining astronomy and 
          geology had been discontinued that year, so I went to St Andrews 
          University which offered the astronomy programme with the best 
          observational equipment in the country. I got the class medal for 
          astrophysics in the second year, but by then had decided I wanted to 
          specialise in theoretical physics. I took classes in cosmology, 
          particle physics, relativity and quantum theory, and in the summer 
          gained a studentship to work at the European Centre for Particle 
          Physics (CERN) near Geneva. I graduated in theoretical physics and 
          mathematics&nbsp; in 1993.<p dir="ltr" align="justify">Next I 
          considered a range of opportunities. I was offered PhD&#39;s in space 
          science, meteorology and the Chicxulub crater, but decided instead to 
          do an MSc in Geophysics at Durham, fully expecting to enter the oil 
          industry as an exploration geophysicist. However, the price of oil 
          crashed in 1994, and no jobs were being offered. My MSc programme was 
          inverting seismic data to detect gas hydrates - a subject linked 
          strongly to global warming, and I got an offer to continue those 
          studies at Cambridge University. The thought of studying Cambridge was 
          highly appealing, but then I saw a PhD advert to work on volcanic 
          earthquakes which said &quot;<i>...the student will gain field experience 
          in New Zealand and Indonesia..</i>.&quot; and I was sold. I went to Leeds 
          University and met Locko over a cup of coffee. The next time we met 
          was on Stromboli volcano about 5am en-route to a conference on the 
          flanks on Mt Etna. <p dir="ltr" align="justify">In 1995 I did indeed 
          travel to New Zealand and Indonesia, to help gather broadband seismic 
          data in volcanic regions in those countries, and then in 1996 I was 
          contracted to work at the Montserrat Volcano Observatory for two 
          months. I found that the &quot;hands-on&quot; observatory work suited me well, 
          and it felt really good to be doing something that really mattered. In 
          1998, after working in the IT industry for a while whilst writing up 
          my PhD thesis, I took a postdoctoral position at the Alaska Volcano 
          Observatory, where I designed a web-based real-time seismic monitoring 
          system for Alaskan Volcanoes, which is still in use today.<p dir="ltr" align="justify">
          In January 2000 I accepted the position of Senior Seismologist at the 
          Montserrat Volcano Observatory. Following a period of neglect and Y2K 
          incompatibilities, the seismic monitoring at MVO was in complete 
          disarray, with data acquisition systems needed to be manually 
          rebooting up to 25 times a day and an average 50% data loss, combined 
          with poor data analysis, lack of spare equipment and a network that 
          was poorly maintained. With a new dome rapidly growing, it became a 
          race against time to put in place robust seismic monitoring, as this 
          was the only technique that could provide continuous surveillance of 
          the volcano given there were no longer enough staff to man the 
          observatory around the clock. <p align="justify">With this challenging 
          situation and MVO being understaffed, I essentially had to do two jobs 
          - as a seismologist and as a software engineer. A robust data 
          acquisition was developed, and a vast array of modern volcano-seismic 
          data analysis software written (in Matlab), as well as the glue to 
          automate data flow (in Perl). Earthworm/Glowworm was installed as the 
          data acquisition system of choice, and all systems were replicated so 
          that should a primary computer fail, a backup computer provided a 
          seamless failover capability. New volcanic alarm systems were 
          designed, along with a diagnostic monitoring system that monitor all 
          possible points of failure in the complex data acquisition, automated 
          analysis and archival systems, and page me whenever any a problem was 
          detected. A major exercise was also undertaken to inventory equipment 
          and procure mission critical spares. On top of working 60-70 hours a 
          week in the office, it was also quite normal to have to answer 3 or 4 
          volcano alarms per night.<p dir="ltr" align="justify">Certainly by 
          2001-2, MVO had one of the leading volcano-seismic monitoring 
          programmes in any observatory worldwide. A huge effort also went in to 
          recovering data from old orphaned media, acquiring online storage and 
          building up online databases of all the seismic data acquired since 
          July 1995, so that these data became accessible for research. I 
          initiated numerous research projects such as: (i) a rockfall location 
          system which was implemented and used at MVO for about 18 months, (ii) 
          an auto-classification of volcano-seismic event types using a neural 
          network, (iii) system for detecting banded tremor and earthquake 
          swarms. I built an integrated remote-monitoring website that was of 
          primary importance for responding to alarms in a timely fashion, and 
          also tried to encourage communication, teamwork and integrated data 
          analysis at MVO, because I believe these are critical in the smooth 
          running and effective functioning of a volcano observatory. <p dir="ltr" align="justify">
          In 2003 safety became critically undermined as a result of internal 
          MVO problems. These problems had been previously acknowledged by BGS 
          International, but overwhelmed by other issues, the MVO Director was 
          unwilling to deal with them, and instead misled senior management 
          while bemoaning them constantly. The upshot was that BGS scientists 
          responsible for the monitoring programmes had to deal with frequent 
          threatening and abusive behaviour from technical staff, truancy, 
          undermining of authority and an almost total lack of technical 
          support. On some occasions technical staff directly compromised 
          monitoring ability by removing vital equipment or deleting software or 
          data. Such was the unwillingness of the MVO Director to tackle such 
          issues, he would instead criticise and threaten his scientific team 
          for reporting them, earning them a reputation for being troublemakers 
          in the eyes of BGS management. I decided this was an untenable 
          situation and asked to be reassigned to other projects in BGS unless 
          this absurd situation was rectified. <p align="justify">I warned BGS 
          that steps needed to be taken to prevent the seismic monitoring 
          collapsing further (including a significant handover period), but 
          again those warnings were dismissed. I returned in 2004 to find the 
          seismic&nbsp; monitoring was once again in disarray, asked for and 
          received permission to patch up the seismic monitoring systems as best 
          I could in the short time available, and wrote a report. Apart from 
          this I was assigned to work on a wide variety of different geophysical 
          and software development projects, but these lacked any common-thread 
          and I was not able to establish any definite role within the BGS 
          matrix-management system. So in 2006, after being unsuccessful in my 
          request to take a period of unpaid leave to undertake training 
          relevant to my job at BGS, I decided it was time to move on, though it 
          was hard to leave many good colleagues and friends at BGS, as well as 
          my house and extended family.<p align="justify">In September 2006 I 
          moved back to Alaska to accept a new challenge as a Seismologist at 
          the Alaska Earthquake Information Center. In what is one of the 
          world&#39;s most seismically active regions, I decided this would be a 
          good place to branch out from the volcano-seismology I had specialised 
          in so far in my career, and learn more about regional and global 
          seismic monitoring. Its been refreshing experience so far.<p dir="ltr" align="justify">&nbsp;<p dir="ltr" align="justify">&nbsp;<p dir="ltr" align="justify">&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</TD></TR>
