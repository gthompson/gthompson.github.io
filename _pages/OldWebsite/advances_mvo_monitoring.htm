<title>Scientific Monitoring of the Soufriere Hills Volcano at the Montserrat 
Volcano Observatory</title>

<p align="justify">Scientific Monitoring of the Soufriere Hills Volcano at the 
Montserrat Volcano Observatory, 2000 - 2003</p>
<p align="justify">Dramatic improvements were made in the scientific monitoring 
programmes between 2000 and 2003 by Ricky Herd, Marie Edmonds and Glenn 
Thompson, which improved scientific understanding of the Soufriere Hills Volcano 
and brought acclaim to the Montserrat Volcano Observatory and the British 
Geological Survey.</p>
<p align="justify">MVO volcanologists Marie Edmonds and Ricky Herd working with 
external collaborators developed a revolutionary sulphur dioxide monitoring 
system between 2001 and 2002 called DOAS/ScanSpec, which provided a cheap, 
automated alternative to laborious manual collection of data with COSPEC. The 
result was about a 100 times improvement in the amount of data acquired, as well 
as freeing them up to perform other work. This breakthrough in the remote 
sensing of volcanic gases was a centrepiece at scientific conferences, the 
subject of an IMAX documentary, and brought much interest from other volcano 
observatories.</p>
<p align="justify">Ricky also developed a new photographic monitoring system. 
Previous attempts by many individuals to monitor the Soufriere Hills Volcano 
with video cameras had only worked temporarily, due to the enormous amount of 
power required, and the maintenance this entailed. Ricky saw that the solution 
to this was instead to use low power (still) digital cameras which nevertheless 
provided a much higher resolution than was possible with any conventional video 
camera. By automating this to take an image one a minute, and installing more 
than one camera station, time lapse video sequences could be made later showing 
the pattern of dome growth and collapse from different vantage points. Moreover, 
MVO finally had the ability to see the volcano in near-real-time, even though 
the observatory building did not itself provide a vantage point.</p>
<p align="justify">The seismic monitoring was in need of much work as a result 
of non-Y2K compliant operating systems and other software, reliance on 
specialist hardware and operating systems difficult to maintain locally, and 
lack of critical spares. While round-the-clock seismic monitoring underpinned 
safety, 50% of data were being lost, and acquisition systems had to be rebooted 
manually up to 25 times a day. The main data analysis computer had also been 
removed in early 1999, along with loss of all its software, during a period in 
which there was no Seismologist at MVO. So the effectiveness of seismic 
monitoring at MVO had significantly declined compared to 1996-1998 levels. 
Moreover, by the standards of US volcano observatories, the seismic monitoring 
at MVO was very outdated.</p>
<p align="justify">Glenn Thompson, who took over as MVO Seismologist in January 
2000, brought a &quot;can-do&quot; approach and considerable experience of developing 
mission critical software at other volcano observatories. The most immediate 
problems were to put in place effective seismic data acquisition and alarm 
systems, as without these, MVO lacked the capability to alert the local and 
aviation authorities to frequent escalations in volcanic activity that could 
endanger lives. With a rapidly growing dome, this was even more critical. 
Datastreams from MVO's two seismic networks were merged for the first time, 
considerably improving the accuracy of event classification and location, and 
increasing efficiency. A vast array of data analysis tools were written in 
Matlab to modernise MVO's seismic monitoring capability and bring it inline with 
that at other leading observatories. Internal webpages were developed to host a 
wide range of near-real-time data which made it possible to make a detailed, yet 
rapid, assessment of all seismic parameters in response to volcanic alarms. 
Several safety nets were built into the seismic monitoring infrastructure 
including standardisation of operating systems and computer hardware for ease of 
maintenance, individual UPS for each computer to reduce brown-outs, 
reconfiguration of critical software to autoreboot in the event of a brown-out, 
mirroring of all mission critical computers to provide failover, on-the-shelf 
ready-to-go backups for each mission critical computer, and a diagnostic alarm 
system which monitored all potential points of failure and paged the 
Seismologist if any concerns were detected and put detailed information on 
internal webpages (the diagnostic alarm system also had a mirror). It was 
through measures such as these that an unprecedented level of seismic monitoring 
was achieved at MVO from 2001 to 2003, and this more than any other activity at 
MVO did the most to ensure safety.</p>
<p align="justify">Massive efforts were also made to secure seismic data and 
make it accessible to researchers. Prior to 2000, data archival had been a 
slightly haphazard affair. Numerous types of media had been used including 
Tracker tapes, CD-R, Zip100 diskettes and DDS-1 DAT tapes. It was the storage of 
the most valuable dataset - seismic data from the digital seismic network - that 
was particularly concerning. The archive software included no checks, and as a 
result a lot of data had been lost. So the first step was to put in place 
robust, foolproof data archival software. Next, there was only around 1GB of 
online storage capacity to store seismic data. New hard drives were acquired 
increasing overall capacity to around 1TB, and the major exercise of extracting 
old data from hundreds of tapes and diskettes began. Online databases were then 
built, and new copies of the data made to high capacity DDS-3 DAT tapes. By 
establishing online databases, first of all it meant new data processing could 
easily be applied to old data. This allowed new derived datasets to be compiled 
for research purposes. Moreover, it also meant that MVO was able to provide 
larger volumes of data to university researchers, and do so in a dramatically 
expediated manner.</p>
<p>In January 2003, MVO completed its move from the north of the island where it 
had been evacuated in 1997, to a purpose-built observatory above the main town 
of Salem, with excellent views of the volcano. Remarkably considering the 
complex data telemetry comprising dozens of field stations of different types 
and repeaters, this move was achieved without the loss of any data, at tense 
time when a new evacuation had come into effect, and all eyes were on the 
volcano. </p>
<p>The considerable advances in monitoring at MVO from 2000-2003 were the direct 
result of the British Geological Survey being able to appoint enthusiastic 
knowledgeable volcanologists and volcano-seismologists, who were primarily 
motivated by developing the monitoring infrastructure at MVO and training local 
staff, rather than pursuing their personal research interests. It was this drive 
that enabled to accomplish so much, despite the inadequacy of technical support, 
and the abusive and threatening behaviour that often went unchallenged at MVO.</p>
