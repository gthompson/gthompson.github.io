# Software

* [GISMO](https://geoscience-community-codes.github.io/GISMO/) is an object-oriented seismic data analysis toolbox for MATLAB. It can also be used to convert seismic data formats. GISMO development has stagnated since [ObsPy](https://docs.obspy.org) became available. 
* [CWAKE](https://github.com/gthompson/cwake) is the *Common Workspace for AlasKan Earthquakes*. It was developed so that the [Alaska Volcano Observatory](http://www.avo.alaska.edu), [Alaska Earthquake Center](http://earthquake.alaska.edu), and researchers using seismic data from Alaska would have access to the same velocity models and default location parameters in the [Antelope environmental monitoring system](http://www.brtt.com), so that hypocenters and magnitudes can be directly compared.
