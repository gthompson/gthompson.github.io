title: "Glenn Thompson / Volcano-Seismologist"
excerpt: "I am a Geophysicist who specializes in seismic and volcano monitoring.
          I design and develop software systems to enhance and streamline seismic
          monitoring operations and to catalyze research that uses seismic data.
          I use geophysical data (primarily seismic and infrasound data) to study
          volcanic activity (including swarms, tremor, pyroclastic flows, and mudflows),
          earthquake sources, explosions (volcanic, chemical, nuclear), and rocket
          launches."
