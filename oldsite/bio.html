          Biography
        </h2>
        <p>
          My career has had 3 main stages:
          <br/>
	  <h3>1996-2013: REAL-TIME MONITORING/OPERATIONS</b>
              <p>
                In 1996 I was hired by the
                <a href="www.bgs.ac.uk">
                  British Geological Survey (BGS)
                </a>
                to help monitor seismicity due to the ongoing eruption of the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoufriÃ¨re_Hills">
                  Soufriere Hills Volcano
                </a>
                , in Montserrat. I was impressed by the systems the US Geological Survey's
		<a href="https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vdap/">VDAP</a> team had installed, and realized that this was something I could build
                on. So I trained as a systems analyst/programmer, and worked in the IT
                industry, before joining the
                <a href="https://www.gi.alaska.edu/">
                  University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute (UAFGI)
                </a>
                in 1998 to build the first web-based volcano-seismic monitoring system
                for the
                <a href="https://avo.alaska.edu/">
                  Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO)
                </a>
		. In 2000, I rejoined <a href="www.bgs.ac.uk">BGS</a> to rebuild and lead the seismic monitoring program
                at the
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030214212801/http://www.mvo.ms/">
                  Montserrat Volcano Observatory (MVO)
                </a>
                , and I expanded the seismic monitoring to locate and quantify pyroclastic
                flow and lahar signals, since those were the primary hazards. In 2006 I
                returned to
                <a href="https://www.gi.alaska.edu/">
                  UAFGI
                </a>
                where I further developed seismic monitoring systems for
                <a href="https://avo.alaska.edu/">
                  AVO
                </a>
                and the
                <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081015035427/http://www.aeic.alaska.edu/">
                  Alaska Earthquake Information Center (AEIC)
                </a>
                (the latter became the
                <a href="">
                  Alaska Earthquake Center (AEC)
                </a>
                in 2013).
              </p>
	      <br/>
	      <b>2013-2018: RESEARCH SUPPORT</b>
              <p>
                Supporting the research of university professors and graduate students
                has always been part of my job, but it became my main role in 2013 when
                I joined the
                <a href="https://www.usf.edu/">
                  University of South Florida (USF)
                </a>
                <a href="https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/geosciences/">
                  School of Geosciences
                </a>
                . This position included roles as Field Technician, Systems Administrator,
                Data Manager, and Programmer for the new Seismology Group. I also taught
                classes in Time Series Analysis, Seismic Data Analysis, and Programming.
              </p>
            <br/>
	    <b>2018-Present: PRIMARY RESEARCH</b>
              <p>
                In 2018 I was given a small startup to help build my own research program. This has enabled me to build upon innovative work I did at                
		<a href="https://www.gi.alaska.edu/">
                UAFGI</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030214212801/http://www.mvo.ms/">
		MVO</a></p> as well as forge collaborations with <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/home/index.html">NASA Kennedy Space Center</a>.
