    <div class='blocktext'><p>Rocket Seismology is an emerging field that focuses on detecting and analyzing seismic and infrasound signals generated by rocket launches. These signals are produced by the immense energy released during liftoff, and they provide valuable insights into both the dynamics of rocket propulsion and the surrounding geological environment. At Kennedy Space Center (KSC), since 2016, various rocket events—such as SpaceX Falcon 9 launches, NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS), and commercial missions—have been extensively monitored for both seismic and infrasound waves.</p>

<p>In addition to tracking the impact of rocket launches on the environment, rocket seismic signals are also used to probe subsurface geological structures. By analyzing the way seismic waves travel through the Earth, researchers can map and study the geological features beneath KSC and nearby regions, including aquifers and fault lines. Infrasound signals, which are low-frequency sound waves generated by rocket engines, are also recorded and analyzed to provide complementary data on the rocket's behavior and atmospheric interactions.
</p><p>
These data help distinguish rocket-related seismic activity from other sources like earthquakes, quarry blasts, or industrial noise. The integration of seismic and infrasound measurements not only enhances safety and environmental monitoring but also contributes to advancing geophysical exploration techniques, providing unique insights into both space exploration and Earth sciences.We are a group of seismologists and other geophysicists at the University of South Florida, dedicated to advancing the understanding of Earth’s dynamic processes through comprehensive monitoring and analysis of natural earthquakes, human-made seismic events, and critical geological features. We envision a future where our cutting-edge research and technologies contribute to accurate discrimination of nuclear tests, quarry blasts, and rocket launches, while also enhancing the detection and monitoring of volcanic activity. By leveraging seismic imaging techniques, we aim to provide essential insights into Florida’s aquifers, ensuring sustainable water resources. Our commitment is to foster scientific excellence and public safety, driving innovation and collaboration for a resilient and informed society.</p>
