	<p class='blocktext'>FLO-VO (pronounced "flow-vee-oh") is a group of geoscientists at the University of South Florida whose aim is to provide a virtual platform and value-added data products that support and enhance the work of active volcano observatories across the USA, Latin America, and the Eastern Caribbean in detecting, analyzing, and forecasting volcanic activity. Our mission is to improve public safety, inform policy decisions, and advance scientific knowledge in volcanology by fostering international collaboration and data accessibility. By bridging the gap between remote monitoring and on-the-ground expertise, we envision a world where local, national, and international observatories can work seamlessly together to predict volcanic hazards, mitigate risks, and protect communities from volcanic disasters. We also run a real-time monitoring lab to simulate a typical volcano observatory environment, to help train, teach, and prepare students for careers in this exciting and important field.</p>

    <!--
<p align='left'>Methods:</p>
        <ul>
		<li>Field Work: We conduct field studies on active and dormant volcanoes, collecting samples of rocks, ash, and gases, and mapping lava flows, pyroclastic deposits, and crater shapes.
        	<li>Monitoring Eruptions: We use specialized equipment (e.g. seismometers) to measure volcanic activity such as volcanic earthquakes and tremors, gas emissions, temperature changes, and lava flow rates.
        	<li>Eruption Forecasting: By analyzing patterns in past eruptions and current activity, we develop models to predict when and how a volcano might erupt.
        	<li>Volcanic Hazards: We assess the impact of eruptions on surrounding environments and communities, including ashfall, pyroclastic flows, lahars (volcanic mudflows), and lava flows.
